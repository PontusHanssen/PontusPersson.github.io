This weekend I participated in East Sweden Hack with three friends. After a
weekend of hacking we had a finished prototype. Our idea was a real time driver
support system that helps drivers drive more safe and eco-friendly. It also
featured gamification elements to encourage drivers to compete with their
friends for the title of being the best driver.

On Sunday we a got a fantastic surprise, we had the best project in the category
"Energy and Sustainability"!

And as a big bonus I won the teams Raspberry Pi 3 by throwing a die! :-D

Our prototype is available at [curbit.xyz](http://curbit.xyz), and the code at github [PontusPersson/esh](https://github.com/PontusPersson/esh).
