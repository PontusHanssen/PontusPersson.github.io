A lab assignment in my AI course required some editing of PDDL domain and
problem specification files. Unfortunately PDDL syntax highlighting was nowhere
to be found, other than treating the files as lisp, so I figured that I should
try to write my own. The plugin is available at [github.com/PontusPersson/pddl.vim](https://github.com/PontusPersson/pddl.vim).

It is not perfect, but I seems to fit my needs for this lab assignment!
